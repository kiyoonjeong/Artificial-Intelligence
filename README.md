# Artificial-Intelligence Projects

## **1. Maze Runner**
- Uninformed Search
  - Find the shortest path by using the BFS / DFS
- Informed Search
  - Find the shortest path by using the information (Manhattan / Euclidean Distance) 
- Compare the results and try to find the harder maze based on the result

## **2. Mine Sweeper**
- Finding out the mines by using the Knowledge Base
- Using the Probability to reduce the failure rate

## **3. Probabilistic Search**
- Find the Target by using the Prior Knowledge
  - Stationary Target / Moving Target
  - Set a rule on which data (prior knowledge) to be used, and compare the performance 

## **4. Colorization**
- Collect the picture with both palm trees and beach, and try to make the models by learning the data (RGB values)
- Colorize the WB picture by using the XGBoost and Linear Model
